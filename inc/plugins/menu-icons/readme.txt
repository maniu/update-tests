Add icons to your wordpress menu items

== Description ==
[Documentation](https://quadlayers.com/portfolio/wp-menu-icons/) | [Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/quadlayers/)

The menu of the site can be so simplest as a list of links without indentation or the complex place in a site.

But most developers fight to provide more complex and more features in their [mega menu](http://quadmenu.com/) plugins and forgot about the users that only need a very simple function that doesn't come in the default WordPress menu.

That's the reason why we've created WP Menu Icons, a plugin that doesn't presume to be the [best WordPress Mega Menu plugin](https://wp.rocks/top-10-best-mega-menu-2018/), but does what it has to do: gives you the ability to include icons into your WordPress menu.
